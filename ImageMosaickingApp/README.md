# Vectorization
MATLAB is optimized for operations involving matrices and vectors.  
Avoid using loops (e.g., for, while) in MATLAB whenever possible â€“ looping can result in long-running code.  
Instead, you should vectorize loops to optimize your code for performance.  
In many cases, [vectorization](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/vectorization.html) also results in more compact code (fewer lines to write!).  
If you are new to MATLAB, refer to [this article](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/techniques-for-improving-performance.html) for some ideas on how to optimize MATLAB code.
